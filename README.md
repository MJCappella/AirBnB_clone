# AirBnB_clone
The first step towards building our first full web application is to write a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects. This step is crucial as we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

# Generally it involves tasks to:

1. Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of your future instances.
2. Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
3. Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherit from BaseModel.
4. Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
5. Create all unit tests to validate all your classes and the storage engine and the  rsource that could help with this is [The link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest).

Basically, This project is a clone of the AirBnB website, aimed at creating a simplified version of the platform. The goal is to develop a full web application that includes a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects, a web front-end for users to interact with the application, and a database for storing data.

##Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python script (console.py) that provides a command-line interface for managing AirBnB objects. It allows users to perform various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting objects. The command interpreter uses the cmd module to implement a simple shell-like interface.

# How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, run the console.py script in your terminal or command prompt:
 
	./console.py

# How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands to interact with it:

1. help: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.
2. quit: Exit the command interpreter.

You can also use the EOF (End of File) shortcut (Ctrl + D on Unix/Linux or Ctrl + Z on Windows) to exit the command interpreter.

Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) quit
$
