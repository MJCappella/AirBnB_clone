## 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
The project involves the building of the user interface for our AirBnB_clone using HTML for the interfaces and CSS for styling. The intro to web application is pretty cool and for me as HTML is widely used almost entirely in every aspect especially when it comes to data retrieval from the user mainly through the logins and other ways which could be either through sign or log in. The basis of CSS is to improve user experience as the nice looking an interface is the more or satisfied the user is. Generally, an attractive thing always appeals.

As we delve  much deeper into the building of our website, the application is set to be fully and 100 percentage user interactive and explicit features added. Lately, we had started our building by coding the console, and also we ventured int the world of mySQL for database management.
